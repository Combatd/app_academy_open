        <p>
        Liver and onions is a dish consisting of slices of liver (usually pork, beef or [in the United Kingdom] lamb) and bulb
        onions; onion is favoured as an accompaniment to liver as the sharp flavour of onion "cuts" the somewhat metallic
        flavour of liver, which can be off-putting to some eaters. The liver and the onions are usually fried or otherwise
        cooked together, but sometimes they may be fried separately and mixed together afterwards. The liver is often cut in
        fine slices, but it also may be diced.
